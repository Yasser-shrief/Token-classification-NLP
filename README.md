Token classification using Bert Model With Huggingface platform 

**Named entity recognition (NER)**: Find the entities (such as persons, locations, or organizations) in a sentence. This can be formulated as attributing a label to each token by having one class per entity and one class for “no entity.” <br>
**Part-of-speech tagging (POS)**: Mark each word in a sentence as corresponding to a particular part of speech (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.).<br>
**Chunking**: Find the tokens that belong to the same entity. This task (which can be combined with POS or NER) can be formulated as attributing one label (usually B-) to any tokens that are at the beginning of a chunk, another label (usually I-) to tokens that are inside a chunk, and a third label (usually O) to tokens that don’t belong to any chunk.
